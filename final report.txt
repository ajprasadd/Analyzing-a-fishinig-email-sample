3. Suspicious Links or Attachments

 Phishing Indicator Detected

4. Urgent or Threatening Language
 Example: “Failure to act within 24 hours will result in permanent account closure.”
 Used to create panic and prompt users to act without thinking.
 Phishing Indicator Detected

5. Mismatched URLs
 Text: “Verify Now” → Looks like Amazon.
 Actual URL: Fake, unrelated domain.

6. Spelling or Grammar Errors
 Phrase: “clicking the secure link below” (awkward phrasing)
 Slight awkwardness, but relatively well-written (some phishing is polished).

Conclusion
  This email is clearly a phishing attempt. It attempts to steal credentials by redirecting the user to a fake Amazon login page. The use of spoofed email, urgent tone, and misleading links are strong indicators.
